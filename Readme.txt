Application Name: MedChain

Project Description: decentralized application, or dApp, on the Ethereum blockchain

1. Install Node.js 10.15.3 LTS available from:
https://nodejs.org/en/

2. Install the Truffle Framework from:
https://truffleframework.com/

3. Install Ganache GUI from:
https://truffleframework.com/ganache

4. Install Google Chrome from:
https://www.google.com/chrome/

5. Install the Metamask extension for Google Chrome from:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en

6. Open the Ganache GUI and enter the Mnemonic: 
sphere future jump off always sting stomach rubber coast just ugly coil

You can enter the above Mnemonic by Selecting the Cog wheel in the upper right corner
and go to the Accounts and Keys menu then enter the Mnemonic there.

8. Open your terminal and run the command: npm dev run

9. Once the MedChain is deployed, then open your browser, and
make sure your on the Localhost 8545 in Metamask. 

10. Then navigate to your localhost.

11. This will bring you to the Provider Portal.

Three buttons will be displayed.

New Authorization
Get Records
Add Record

12. Click on New Authorization to simulate
a patient authorizing a provider to access
their medical record. This will be a separate
app in the future that a patient can install 
on a mobile phone using the Google Playstore 
for example.

13. Here the Patient will enter their private
key into the app to signify the authentication
to a selected provider.

14. Next, click on Get Records.

This will simulate the provider getting the patients
records.

15. Next, click on Add Record.

This will simulate the provider adding to the patients record.

16. Congratulations! MedChain is now deployed
and you can simulate the functionality
of MedChain's features.
